# Resume-Classification
A machine learning project that classifies resumes into job categories like Data Science, HR, and  Software Development using NLP and classification models. It streamlines recruitment by automating resume screening, reducing manual effort, and speeding up candidate selection.
ABSTRACT: Resume Classification is a machine learning-based project designed to automate the sorting and categorization of resumes into predefined job roles such as Data Science, Software Development, Human Resources, Marketing, and more. This system aims to optimize the recruitment pipeline by reducing manual screening time and increasing the efficiency of candidate shortlisting. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model analyzes unstructured text data from resumes, extracts relevant features, and classifies them using supervised learning algorithms. The project demonstrates a real-world application of data science in HR technology and provides a scalable solution for resume filtering and job role prediction.
